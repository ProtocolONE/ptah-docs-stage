"},{"idx":17,"href":"/docs/seo/","title":"Search engine optimization","content":" SEO checklist for your gaming landing page The best SEO strategies help you to increase organic traffic and rankings in search engines.\nFirst of all, you should always keep in touch that your website is designed for humans who use search engines.\nAs follows, you have to optimize your content by already knowing what words and phrases your audience is searching for.\n  Ptah helps you to optimize landing page perfectly. It\u0026rsquo;s the essential part that increases traffic to your web page. We recommend using Ptah Settings to adjust SEO parameters of your landing page.\nTo achieve the goals of your landing page you can follow this checklist:\nFor the web page URLs:\n Choose the right domain name for your page Set up the secure protocol HTTPS Keep reader-friendly URLs  For the web page descriptions:\n Add a page title Add a page description Upload a favicon  For typography:\n Structure your pages with headings Make your content skimmable  For links:\n Social media links  For images and videos:\n Optimize visual data  After you launched the landing page:\n Verify and index your site  Choose the right domain name First of all, the domain name must be easy-to-read and brandable.\nMoreover, search engines look at the domain to understand what your site is about and to decide how to rank it. For this reason, keywords that are relevant to your game should appear somewhere in the URL.\nFor example: Your company name is WonderWorld, thus the domain for a game can be like wonderworldgames.com.\nSet up the secure protocol HTTPS Start using HTTPS because this protocol uses an SSL certificate to move data. It gives your users peace of mind when sharing potentially sensitive data on a website.\nMoreover, at the Chrome browser’s alerting system looks more reliable for the user if the website uses HTTPS protocol:\n  Keep reader-friendly URLs  Keep URL short  A well-designed URL provides a reader-friendly link for humans and an easy-to-understand link for search engines. More than that, do not use too many similar words in a URL to avoid a keyword stuffing if you.\n Use hyphens to separate words in URL  Google recommends using hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_) in your URLs.\n Use lowercase letters in URL  Search engines can decrypt from uppercase and lowercase letters in URLs, which can lead to duplicate URLs and loss of page rank.\nAdd a page title The title and description mean that you can tell for a search engine exactly what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about to categorize and understand your web page. Remember, the title appears in search engines and the Web browser’s title bar.\n  To add a page title, click the Settings icon on the top menu. Choose the SEO tab to enter a title text and click Save.   The recommended format for the title is: Primary Keyword – Secondary Keyword | Brand  The primary keyword must be unique to that page in that there is only one page dedicated to that primary keyword.\nFor example: Mobile endless runner – Wild Fastest Animals | WonderWorld\n Use only one Title Tag and one H1 Header on the web page  Include the page’s primary keyword in both tags. Each page title should be unique.\n Keep your title under 60 characters  It\u0026rsquo;s not a character limit, but you can take into account, that the title length in search results depends on the display width.\nAdd a page description The page description provides a summary of a web page. Search engines such often display the page description in search results.\n   Use your keywords at the beginning at the description  Note, search engines bold keywords in the description when they match search queries. You should match your descriptions to search terms as closely as possible.\n Keep your description under 160 characters  It\u0026rsquo;s not a character limit, but you can take into account, that the description length depends on the display width, search engine and others.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t include double quotation marks  It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from descriptions to prevent removing the description from search results.\n Each page descriptions should be unique  Define a favicon to show in search results Favicon is a visual representation of your website\u0026rsquo;s brand on browser tabs and in search results. That\u0026rsquo;s why the uploaded favicon leads to the brand recognition in search results.\nTo upload a favicon, click the Settings icon on the top menu. Choose the SEO tab to upload a favicon and click Save.  Recommended favicon parameters:\n Name: only use letters, numbers and hyphens (instead of underscores) Format: ico, bmp, png Size: 32x32 px  Structure your pages with headings Search engines typically give headings a higher priority. Hence, use subheaders to break up sections: H2, H3 and so on till H6. So, you can use them to insert your primary keyword in H2 and other keywords in H3, etc.\nYou can use Ptah Settings to set up fonts for headings and text.\n Use only one H1 tag per page Use different text in each headings, without duplicates Optimize your headings with keywords  Make your content skimmable You can use Ptah pre-designed sections and elements to organize content:\n Columns Products System requirements Icon with text     Take a look at how to adjust the ready-to-use sections.\nSocial media links Encourage people to share your content using your social media links.
